In this challenge, I extracted data from a recent study on drug treatments for Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) in 249 mice to generate tables and figures for technical reports.

Initially, I merged separate DataFrames of mouse metadata and study results into a single DataFrame. Then, I cleaned the DataFrame by identifying and removing duplicate data.

Following data cleaning, I constructed a final DataFrame with the drug regimen as the index column and computed statistics such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume.

Next, I generated bar charts illustrating the Mouse ID/Timpoints for each drug regimen and pie charts displaying the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.

Finally, I performed quartile calculations to identify outliers and created box plots, line plots, scatter plots, and a linear regression model to analyze high-level data.
